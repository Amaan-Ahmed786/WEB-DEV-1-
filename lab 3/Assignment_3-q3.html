            <p> It has a theoretical top speed of 310mph, however it’s never actually done this in the real world. The Jesko Absolut holds plenty of other records which suggest it’ll be able to deliver on this promise, including the world record for the fastest time taken to go from 0-400kmh (249mph) and then back to zero again, completing the run in 27.83 seconds.</p>

            <p>The Americans know how to make a V8 engine, and the SSC Tuatara (Too-ah-ta-ra) has a twin-turbocharged eight-cylinder which puts out up to 1,750hp when it’s running on ethanol rather than petrol. However, there is some controversy around the official top speed.</p>

            <h3>3. Hennessey Venom F5</h3>

            <p>Hennessey has a reputation for making some of the fastest cars in the world, and the Venom F5 is no exception. It’s powered by a 6.6-litre twin-turbo V8 engine which produces a staggering 1,817hp. Hennessey claims that the Venom F5 can reach a top speed of 311mph (501km/h), which would make it the fastest production car in the world.</p>
